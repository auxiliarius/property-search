# Property Search

### Usage:

1. Click "Code" in the top right and choose "Download ZIP".
1. Export the existing spreadsheet as a CSV file from Google Spreadsheets and download locally to your computer.
1. Open up a terminal, and run the CLI like so (from within the property-search script folder): `./index.js path/to/csv/name-of-file.csv`
1. Once completed, it will log some messages in the console and the new file can be found at `name-of-file-new.csv` w/ extra address column at the start.
1. Can then just use this new spreadsheet, or re-import it to Google Spreadsheets and just copy/paste column A from the new spreadsheet over to your existing one.

### Requirements

Need a (fairly modern) verison of NodeJS installed on the machine.
